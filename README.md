# PerformanceComparisonOfSeachAlgorithms
This repository is about comparing the performance of search algorithms which are Brute force, Horspool and Boyer-Moore. In this repository, there are 3 c source code for each algorithm implementations. These programs take a pattern as an input and search it on a text file which is pointed by user and it gives pattern position, number of character comparison and total run time of algorithm so you can compare the performance of Brute force, Horspool and Boyer-Moore algorithms.
